# etch-a-sketch

Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.

Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line).

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.
Also check out prompts.

You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.node
